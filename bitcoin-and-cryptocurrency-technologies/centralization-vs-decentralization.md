# Centralization vs Decentralization

Usually, in complex system, decentralization is not all-or-nothing (e.g. the email protocol is decentralized but there are private email providers).

## Aspects of decentralization in cryptocurrencies

- Who maintains the ledger?
- Who has authority over transactions validity?
- Who creates new *coins*?
- Who determines how the rules of the system change?
- How does the currency acquire exchange value?

Note that the cryptocurrencies protocols usually are decentralized but services built around them may be centralized (e.g. exchanges).

## Aspects of decentralization in Bitcoin

1. **Bitcoin is based on a p2p network:** anybody is allowed to join the network. Also, the barrier to entry is really low.
2. **Mining:** anyone is allowed to mine Bitcoins, but in this case the power concentrates in few entities in the network.
3. **Software updates:** Bitcoin core developers are trusted by the whole community and thus they have a centralized power over the network.
